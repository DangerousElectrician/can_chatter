The mbed-cli has some issues with default_build and default_lib
	They mean the same thing
	Hacked to work with hasattr

eclipse is hard, I'm using openocd and gdb directly

make DEBUG=1 produces a bin that is different from regular make
	DEBUG=1 allegedly does something with optimizations that make it easier to debug
	add -g to CC_FLAGS when debugging
	Mbed uses both c and cpp compilers. Each compiler needs to have debug flags added, but not both as the debug symbols take up too much space

st-flash write Unnamed_Project.bin 0x8000000

openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/st_nucleo_f0.cfg
arm-none-eabi-gdb Unnamed_Project.elf
target remote :3333
info functions

stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 2000000
sudo slcan_attach -f -s8 -o /dev/ttyACM0
sudo slcand ttyACM0 slcan0
sudo ip link set slcan0 up

The previous lines don't work, the following lines do
sudo slcand -o -c -s8 /dev/ttyACM1 slcan0
sudo ip link set slcan0 up

cansend slcan0 123#1122334455667788
candump slcan0

the problem is with serial receive
readable() keeps returning 0
serial receive has issues running echoing program when above at least 1000000
max baudrate is 460800 before bytes start getting lost
